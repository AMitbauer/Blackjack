Python Program that Runs Blackjack

This Program runs Blackjack against the Bank.

Your goal is to beat the bank and make as much money as possible.

The rules are as follows:

1. First, you decide how much you want to bet. Your starting budget is 5000 CHF
2. Afterwards, you and the bank get dealt your starting hand (2 Cards)
3. You can decide if you want to get another card (type "hit") or stay with your current hand (type "stand")
4. If you win, you will receive your bet twofold back.
5. If it is a draw, you receive your bet back. 

Values of Hands:
-All cards are worth their Face Value, i.e. 6 is worth 6, 9 is worth 9.
-Face Cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10
-Ace is worth 11 or 1, depending on which is more favorable to you
-If your starting hand is any Face Card and an Ace, you have a Blackjack! You will receive your bet in a ratio of 3:2, u
nless the bank has a Blackjack as well.
-If you have a Triple Seven, you win no matter what the Bank has.

After each round, you can choose to keep playing or cash out.

Enjoy!
